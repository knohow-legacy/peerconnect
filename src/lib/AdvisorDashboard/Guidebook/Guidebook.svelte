    <h2>Peerconnect Handbook</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Peerconnect! The goal as an Advisor is to assist students whom you believe you can truly help. Below are a few use cases for the platform, and how you can help students!</p>
    <p>## Tutoring</p>
    <p>If you intend to tutor other students using this platform, choose your "Subjects" to cover the subjects you wish to tutor in. </p>
    <p>## Chatting</p>
    <p>If you intend to just chat with people using this platform, please choose the "Just Chatting" interest in your attributes. Feel free to also select some of your hobbies so you can be matched up with people with those same hobbies.</p>
    <p>## Support / Mental Health Help</p>
    <p>Please remember that unless you are a proper mental health professional, you should refer peers to the appropriate hotlines/helplines. </p>
    <p>Please remember to use this platform in good faith and to be respectful to everyone! With your help, Peerconnect can be a thriving community for thousands!</p>
