# PeerConnect
PeerConnect is a network that helps connect students who want to talk to advisors who are ready to listen.

This app was created by Hershraj Niranjani and Alexander Sherbrooke for the Hackathon By The Sea 2023. You can view [the backend here](https://github.com/knohow/peerconnect-backend).
